# Flipkart Scraper

## Overview
This project provides a web scraping tool to extract details of Samsung phones listed on Flipkart. It uses Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for sending HTTP requests and parsing HTML content. The project is designed to help users gather product data for analysis, comparison, or personal reference in a structured and efficient manner.

## Features
- **Product Details Scraping**: Fetches key information such as:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Specifications (e.g., features, storage options, etc.)
  - Ratings and Reviews (if available)
- **Customizable Target**: While this version is tailored for Samsung phones, the logic can be extended to scrape other categories like laptops, home appliances, or clothing by modifying URL parameters.
- **Robust Parsing**: Handles changes in Flipkart's webpage structure by using CSS selectors, making it adaptable to minor website updates.
- **Scalable Codebase**: Can be integrated into larger projects for e-commerce analysis or research.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scraper, ensure the following are set up on your system:

1. **Python 3.x Installed**:
   Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/) if not already installed.

2. **Required Python Libraries**:
   - `requests`: To make HTTP requests and fetch web page content.
   - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing and navigating HTML content.

   Install these libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
